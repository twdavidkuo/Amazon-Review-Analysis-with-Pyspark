The aim of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on the amazon review dataset. You can find the entire dataset at the link:

The total size of the dataset is around 50 gb after decompression, and the data are saved in the form of tsv.

Most of the data analysis, preprocessing, and model development are completed in PySpark, and the `review_preprocessing.py` file contains some basic functions to transform the data type, tokenize, and vectorize the textual data.

To run the code, you will have to change the directory to your personal computer or AWS, Azure, GCP bucket path.
The execution summary can be found in the summary.pdf file.
